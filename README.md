# caelestia-dots/shell

This is **quickshell config**, modified to fit my system requirements. Special thanks to [soramanew](https://github.com/soramanew) for his awesome rice: [caelestia-dots/shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell) which is the base of this project.

I am aiming for it to be minimalist and tailored specifically for use with [**niri**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri), and learn quickshell along the way.
